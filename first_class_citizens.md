## First class citizens.

In programming languages, first class citizens are entities that have the abiltiy to operate like all other entities. Generally first class 
citizens have the following attributes defined by [Robin Popplestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Popplestone):
- [ ] They can be actual parameters of functions
- [ ] They can be returned as a result of functions
- [ ] They can be subject of assignment statements
- [ ] They can be tested for equality
 
Entities that are first class citizens differ from one programming language to another. In python every object that can be named can be classified as a 
first class citizens. This means that *functions*, *classes*, *methods*, *modules* and virtually all data types have the attributes described above.
