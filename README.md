# bits-of-python

Everyday, as I continue to work with python as a programming language, I discover new things about it that makes me appreciate the work that has been put into it's creation. My most natural response to things I appreciate like this is to write about it, and that is what this repository is all about. Just bits and peices of what makes python a beautiful language and not lengthy articles. 

P.S This is not a repository that teaches how to program with python and I imagine that people who would be attracted to this repository are people that are already conversant either with the language, or fundamental programming concepts and paradigms.
